				Gettin' Griddy is a lightweight, simple, 12-column CSS grid system. With the ability to add different column widths for mobile.The column classes start with 'c' with the number of columns added, for example: c12, for a full width element. Change the width in mobile view by adding a class starting with 'm', for example: m6, for a half-width element. For a whitespace gap to the left of the element, add the class starting 'g' with the width of the gap you want, for example: g3, for a gap of three columns. To have a different length gap on mobile, use the prefix 'mg', for example: mg8, for a gap of eight columns on the mobile view.
